# Image and Video Analysis Projects

This repository contains projects from the **Image and Video Analysis** course at **ECE NTUA (8th semester)**.  
Each project explores different aspects of image and video processing using Python and Jupyter Notebooks.

## 📁 Projects Overview

### 🔹 Laplacian Pyramid
- **Description:** Implementation of the Laplacian pyramid for multi-scale image representation. Implementation of formulas according to *The Laplacian Pyramid as a Compact Image Code* by Burt, P. J., and Adelson, E. H. ([paper](https://persci.mit.edu/pub_pdfs/pyramid83.pdf))
- **Notebook Structure:** The theory is included within Markdown cells in the `.ipynb` file.
- **Topics Covered:** Image decomposition (Gaussian filters for smoothing and downscaling), Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids, reconstruction (quantization and decoding).

More projects will be added progressively.
